# data_science_projects
I won't bore you with too much explanation about my projects.

This page lists a series of data science projects I've done. The current projects included here are:

1. A/B testing on Metacritic user scores and global video game sales.
  - The purpose here was to check if user scores could give us information on how much a game sales in the global market.
  
2. Supervised learning done on a prison inmate survey distributed by The Marshall Project.
  - The purpose of this project was to see if I could predict political party affiliation of prison inamtes from an approx 30-question survey

3. Unsupervised learning done on wine tasting:
  - This was a small, quick personal project to see if I could cluster wine tasting "quality" ratings based on wine characteristics such as aciditiy, grape variety, etc.
